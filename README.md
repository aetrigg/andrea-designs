# ANDREA DESIGNS

Hello and thank you so much for viewing my repository for my personal website, [Andrea Designs](https://designsbyandrea.me)! This website was built using React and is currently mobile responsive for most smartphones. I have many plans to add more to this website in the future, and will be utilizing this repo to push my changes to Netlify.

## TODO
[] Make website responsive for tablets, iPad Pro
[] Create mobile component for portfolio projects
[] Create shop (component?? separate repo??)
